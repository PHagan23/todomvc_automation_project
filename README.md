# todomvc_automation_project

Run EndToEnd class for full test suite -- ValueTests are kept seperate

Improvements that could be made:

* Stricter naming conventions
* Find ways to hit nested buttons
* Look for way to check for strikethrough
* Comment more and earlier for better communication with Team
* Keep POM clear and ordered so it's easier to refer to as tests are built and the POM is extended
* Refactor as you go rather than forgetting what you were going to do yesterday
